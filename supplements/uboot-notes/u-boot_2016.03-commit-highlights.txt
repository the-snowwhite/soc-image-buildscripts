    socfpga: Modify qts-filter args to allow input for bsp generated files and quartus project directories

    The hps_isw_handoff and bsp/generated folders are typically not in the same
    path.This patch adds support for specifying the different input directories for
    the bsp and quartus projects.

    net: phy: micrel: fix divisor value for KSZ9031 phy skew

    The picoseconds to register value divisor(ps_to_regval) should be 60 and not
    200. Linux has KSZ9031_PS_TO_REG defined to be 60 as well. 60 is the correct
    divisor because the 4-bit skew values are defined from 0x0000(-420ps) to
    0xffff(480ps), increments of 60.

    For example, a DTS skew value of 420, represents 0ps delay, which should be 0x7.
    With the previous divisor of 200, it would result in 0x2, which represents a
    -300ps delay.

    With this patch, ethernet on the SoCFPGA DE0 Atlas is now able to work with
    1Gb ethernet.

    arm: Replace test for CONFIG_ARMV7 with CONFIG_CPU_V7

    The arch/arm/lib/cache-cp15.c checks for CONFIG_ARMV7 and if this macro is
    set, it configures TTBR0 register. This register must be configured for the
    cache on ARMv7 to operate correctly.

    The problem is that noone actually sets the CONFIG_ARMV7 macro and thus the
    TTBR0 is not configured at all. On SoCFPGA, this produces all sorts of minor
    issues which are hard to replicate, for example certain USB sticks are not
    detected or QSPI NOR sometimes fails to write pages completely.

    The solution is to replace CONFIG_ARMV7 test with CONFIG_CPU_V7 one. This is
    correct because the code which added the test(s) for CONFIG_ARMV7 was added
    shortly after CONFIG_ARMV7 was replaced by CONFIG_CPU_V7 and this code was
    not adjusted correctly to reflect that change.

    arm: socfpga: Fix ethernet reset handling

    The following patch caused cpu_eth_init() to not be called anymore
    for DM-capable boards:

    commit c32a6fd07b1839e4a45729587ebc8e1c55601a4d
    Date:   Sun Jan 17 14:51:56 2016 -0700
	net: Don't call board/cpu_eth_init() with driver model

    This breaks ethernet on SoCFPGA, since we use that function to un-reset
    the ethernet blocks. Invoke the ethernet reset function from arch_misc_init()
    instead to fix the breakage.

    usb: dwc2: disable erroneous overcurrent condition

    For the case where an external VBUS is used, we should enable the external
    VBUS comparator in the driver. This would prevent an unnecessary overcurrent
    error which would then disable the host port.

    The overcurrent condition was happening on the SoCFPGA Cyclone5 devkit, thus
    USB was not working on the devkit. This patch fixes that problem.
